spark4pi-* is a modular hardware platform for managed
instrument implementations controlled over Raspberry Pi
compatible 40 pin interface. The design is inspired by 
the Spark hardware platform for networking as form factor
but with a Raspberry Pi 40 pin connector as management
interface instead of 96boards.

The spark4pi-digital-io
has 6x SMA connectors connected to input and outut 3.3V drivers
with configurable direction that are connected to GPIOs on the
Raspberry Pi connector. 2 GPIOs per channel one for selection
direction and one for the actual signal.

The project includes the following components:
1. board - schematic and PCB design files for KiCAD
2. mechanical - technical documentation for production
 of a 1U 19 inch rack mountable ESD Acrylic box.
3. board-pi-bridge - design files for board that
 connects together a Pi compatible board with the instrument
 extension base board mounted to the left of the Pi compatible
 control board.
