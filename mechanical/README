Blue  - Engrave (or make a pocket with CNC) 2 mm deep for the screw heads - all blue circles.
Cyan  - Engrave logo and port numbers with appropriate settings.
Red   - Cut. 
Green - Cut. Add clearance fit tollerances​if needed ​ (openings are 4 mm) so it is your responsibily to use correct slack if you need to. 1 mm seems to be OK option.
Black and Yellow - Informational. Board outlines. Ignore when cutting.
